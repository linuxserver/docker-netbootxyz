  To use this image you need an existing DHCP server where you can set this TFTP server as your DHCP boot destination. This image does not contain a DHCP server nor do we aim to support one in the future. This is simply a TFTP server hosting the latest IPXE kernel builds from [netboot.xyz]({{ project_url }}). If you are interested in their project and lack the ability to setup a DHCP server to boot this payload they also have USB stick images you can use available on their [downloads page]({{ project_url }}/downloads/).
  
  ### Router Setup Examples

  #### PFSense
  Services -> DHCP Server
  Set both the option for "TFTP Server" and the options under the Advanced "Network Booting" section. 
  * check enable
  * Next server- IP used for TFTP Server
  * Default BIOS file name- `netboot.xyz.kpxe`
  
  #### DD-WRT
  Administration->Services -> Additional DNSMasq Options
  Set the following line: 
  ```
  dhcp-boot=netboot.xyz.kpxe,,YOURSERVERIP
  ```
  
  #### Tomato
  Advanced -> DHCP/DNS -> Dnsmasq Custom configuration
  Set the following line: 
  ```
  dhcp-boot=netboot.xyz.kpxe,,YOURSERVERIP
  ```
  
  #### OpenWRT
  ```
  uci set dhcp.@dnsmasq[0].dhcp_boot=netboot.xyz.kpxe,,YOURSERVERIP
  uci commit
  /etc/init.d/dnsmasq restart
  ```
  
  Anything else from a router standpoint is a crapshoot for supporting Dnsmasq options or proprietary PXE boot options, check Google for support (try your exact router model number with 'pxe boot') or look into setting up your own DHCP server in Linux.
  
  This image also contains `netboot.xyz.efi` which can be used to boot using UEFI network boot. The UEFI boot and menu will have limited functionality if you choose to use it.
